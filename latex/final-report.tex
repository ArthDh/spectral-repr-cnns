% options are used. Do not use these unless you have good reason to do so as
% they can result in nonIEEE compliant documents. User beware. ;)

% For Computer Society journals, IEEEtran defaults to the use of

% (uncomment the ones you want to load)



% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
%
% thumbpdf filename.pdf
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
%
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***
% *** TITLE/SUBJECT/AUTHOR/KEYWORDS INFO BELOW!!           ***
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.).
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted

% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:

%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}

% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark (Computer Society journal
% papers don't need this extra clearance.)

This project is an attempt to implement the ideas and replicate the results of [Rippel, Snoek and Adams 2015]. The paper introduces two ideas to improve training of CNNs: spectral pooling, a novel approach to dimensionality reduction, and spectral filter parameterization, which represents convolutional filters in the spectral domain to help train the network in fewer epochs. The main technical challenge was to \textbf{not screw up the Fourier transforms, need to write this better}. Although we successfully implemented the paper's novel ideas in TensorFlow, we were unable to replicate the improved training results that the original authors report.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} impressive achievements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision in recent years. CNNs have won the annual ImageNet competition every year since the introduction of AlexNet [ paper reference ] in 2012 and have rapidly come to dominate the research landscape for computer vision. As their name suggests, CNNs are deep feedforward neural networks mostly composed of successive layers that first compute the convolution (actually the cross-correlation) of the input image with a set of learned filters, then apply a nonlinear activation function to the result of the convolution, and finally reduce the dimensionality of the resulting activations through an operation such as max-pooling before repeating the process.

The Fourier transform, in both its continuous and discrete forms, maps convolution in the spatial domain to multiplication in the spectral domain and is often used internally at the hardware or software level by libraries such as NVIDIA's cuDNN that provide APIs to efficiently compute convolutions. Rippel, Snoek and Adams claim that the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can be used not only to improve the efficiency of computing the convolution itself, but also to improve the training of CNNs in three distinct ways. Their first proposal is to represent the learned CNN filters as complex numbers in the frequency domain instead of as real numbers in the spatial domain. The second proposal is to replace the max-pooling layer that is typically found in CNNs with a spectral pooling layer, which shrinks the dimensionality with significantly less information loss for the same degree of parameter reduction. The third proposal is to use a modified version 
of the spectral pooling operation as a regularization technique similar to dropout.

Our objectives in this project were, first, to successfully implement the proposals of original paper in TensorFlow and implement a CNN employing these proposals, and, second, to replicate the improved training results reported by the authors. There were a number of challenges we encountered while implementing these novel proposals. The first was conceptual: making sure we properly understood the intricacies involved in shifting back and forth between the spatial and frequency domains for both the filters (in the case of spectral filter parameterization) and the images (for spectral pooling and frequency dropout). The second involved actually implementing the spectral pooling and frequency dropout operations. Although these operations are conceptually straightforward, implementing them correctly required careful attention to detail. The third challenge we faced involved backpropagating the gradient to the the convolution filters when they were parameterized as complex numbers in the frequency domain. The final challenge was faithfully replicating the details of the authors' multiple network architectures, which are described tersely with many different parameters.

\section{Original Paper}

\subsection{Methodology}
The original paper proposes spectral filter parameterization as an alternate formulation for the learned weight matrices of CNNs. In this formulation, which has the equivalent expressive power and capacity as the traditional formulation, the parameters are represented as the complex coefficients of the DFT of the traditional convolution filters. The authors claim that this formulation is more suitable for optimization than the traditional formulation and compare the convergence time (measured in optimization epochs, not in wall-clock time) of CNNs parameterized with spatial to CNNs parameterized with spectral filters. 

The authors also propose spectral pooling as an alternative to max-pooling for reducing the dimensionality of the image as it is transformed throughout the neural network. They argue that this pooling operation preserves information better than max-pooling and quantify this by comparing the approximation loss of the two pooling techniques. They propose a network architecture consisting of alternating convolutional and spectral-pooling layers in which the only form regularization is frequency dropout and weight decay and achieve impressive accuracy rates on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets by optimizing the hyperparameters of their architecture.

\subsection{Key Results}
The potential explanatory variables we included in our models were:
The first key result of the original paper is that spectral pooling preserves information better than max pooling, which they demonstrate both visually, by showing a series of images whose dimensionality has been reduced by the two methods, and quantitatively, by computing the approximation loss, measured as the L2 norm of the difference of the pooled and unpooled images. The second key result is the error rates of 8.6\% and 31.6\%, respectively, that they achieve on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with their proposed CNN architecture. The third key result is the improved convergence time they achieve using the Adam optimizer. They measure this time by comparing the number of training epochs for the traditionally parameterized CNN and the spectrally parameterized CNN to converge to the same error rate.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Implementation}
We first implemented the paper's three proposals in TensorFlow. Since the concepts proposed were not immediately obvious upon reading the original paper, we have included a description here of precisely how these were implemented; we trust that these proposals accurately reflect the authors' intentions. 

\subsubsection{Spectral Filter Parameterization}
In a traditionally parameterized CNN, a single convolutional layer transforms a three-dimensional tensor of shape $(C_{input}, H_{input}, W_{input})$ to a three-dimensional tensor of shape 
$(C_{output}, H_{output}, W_{output})$ by computing the cross-correlation of the three-dimensional volume at every x- and y-dimension of the input tensor with $C_{output}$ separate filters. Here, C denotes the number of channels of the tensor, H denotes the height of the tensor and W denotes the width of the tensor. For each of the $C_{output}$ filters, the learned parameters involved in this transformation consist of a set of real numbers that constitute the weights of the filter and a bias term. In a spectrally parameterized CNN, the convolution operation itself is identical, but the learned parameters are the complex coefficients of the DFT of the filter as opposed to the filter weights themselves. Given an input tensor and the complex numbers that constitute the spectral parameters for the filter, the output tensor is computed by first computing the inverse DFT of the filter and then convolving the resulting filter with the input tensor as usual. 

We implemented this proposal in TensorFlow by writing a custom convolutional layer class where the Variables (TensorFlow's learned parameters) correspond to the complex DFT coefficients instead of the filter weights. 

\subsubsection{Spectral Pooling}

In most CNN architectures, the operation of the network gradually transforms an input image with 3 channels (R, G, and B values) and a large height and weight dimension (e.g. 3 x 32 x 32 or 3 x 224 x 224) to an output "image" consisting of a large (e.g., 512) number of channels and a small (e.g. 5x5, 3x3, or even 1x1) number of height and weight "pixels". Different CNN architectures achieve this in different ways, but one common approach is to use max-pooling to downsample the image periodically; for example, after every convolutional layer, or after every other convolutional layer, max-pooling may be used to cut the height and weight of the image roughly in half. With spectral pooling, the dimensionality reduction is instead performed by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing the two-dimensional DFT of the input tensor for each input channel
\item Truncating the resulting frequency matrix to the desired output dimensionality
\item Computing the inverse DFT of the truncated frequency matrix to obtain the output tensor for the given channel
\end{itemize}

The truncation operation requires careful attention to detail in order to produce a real-valued output tensor. The DFT of a real-valued signal in the spatial domain obeys certain complex symmetries in the frequency domain; specifically, F[s, t] is the complex conjugate of F[-s, -t]; and, for a finite frequency matrix, if (s,t) and (-s,t) coincide modulo the dimension of the matrix, then F[s,t] must be real-valued; for example, the DC component, F[0,0] must be real valued, and for a 16 x 16 frequency matrix, F[8,8], F[0,8] and F[8,0] must also be real-valued. As a result, when an even-numbered output dimension is desired, the input frequency matrix cannot simply be truncated; the complex symmetries governing the original frequency matrix are not the same as the ones governing the truncated matrix. The paper refers to the need to handle these corner cases carefully but does not include the algorithm itself. 

We implemented this proposal in TensorFlow by writing a custom spectral pooling function and layer class that always produces a truncated frequency matrix obeying the required complex symmetries. As with max-pooling, this layer has no learned parameters.

\subsubsection{Frequency Dropout}

This proposal is related to spectral pooling and is implemented in the same class, but serves a different purpose. The frequency matrix is computed for each input channel as before, but instead of being truncated to a smaller dimensionality, a brick-wall low-pass filter is instead applied: the higher frequencies are simply set to zero. The cutoff frequency for the filter is chosen randomly for each minibatch as a method of regularization. In the paper, this regularization is applied as part of the spectral pooling operation.

We implemented this proposal in TensorFlow by writing a function to perform the required filtering and incorporating the function into the spectral pooling layer. 

\subsection{Result Replication}

We attempted to reproduce the three key results of the original paper. The impressive classification rates in the original paper required an intense hyperparameter optimization over six separate hyperparameter dimensions that would have required more computational resources than we had available for this project, but the authors report most of the results of their optimization. For the parameters where they reported optimal results, we used those and attempted to search over the others. For the other two key results, we followed their methodology as closely as possible.

\subsubsection{Information Preservation}

\subsubsection{Spectral Pooling and Frequency Dropout for Traditionally Parameterized CNNs}

We implemented a CNN class implementing the architecture specified in section 5.1 of the original paper. This architecture begins with M pairs of alternating layers of convolutional and spectral-pooling/frequency dropout layers, followed by a 1x1 convolutional layer with multiple filters, a 1x1 convolutional layer outputting the number of target classes, finally followed by a global averaging layer over which the softmax was computed for classification. The optimal hyperparameters which were not specified in the original paper were the number of layers and the weight decay rate. We performed hyperparameter search over a subsample of CIFAR-10 dataset to identify the optimal parameters. As we used the Adam optimizer instead of SGD with momentum, we added the initial learning rate and the dimensionality decay rate gamma to the set of hyperparameters over which we searched. We anneal the learning rate by 50\% after every ten epochs. We randomly chose parameters on a log scale for the L2 norm and the learning rate and on a uniform scale for gamma and the number of layers M. We ran this search in parallel across multiple GPU instances and trained the network on the full datasets once the optimal hyperparameters had been identified. In addition to the random hyperparameter search, we also attempted to identify good hyperparameters by manually tuning.

\subsubsection{Optimization Convergence Speed}

To test the convergence speed of spectral parameterization, we created two new CNN architectures ? deep and generic. The deep architecture is defined in the paper as two 96-filter convolutional layers, a 3x3 stride 2 max pool, three 192-filter convolutional layers, a 3x3 stride 2 max pool, a 192-filter 1x1 convolutional layer, a 10-filter 1x1 convolutional layer, and a global averaging layer. The generic architecture is a more standard CNN, with a 96-filter convolutional layer, 3x3 stride 2 max pool, 192-filter convolutional layer, 3x3 stride 2 max pool, then fully connected layers with sizes of 1024 and 512. Both architectures end with a softmax to compute the probabilities of each sample belonging to each of the 10 classes. We also tested with the spectral pooling architecture described in section 3.2.2. For each of these three architectures, we trained 4 different configurations ? 3x3 kernels with spectrally parameterized conv weights, 3x3 kernels with standard conv weights, and the same thing with 5x5 kernels.

With all of our architectures defined, we used a standard training procedure, feeding mini-batches of 128 images through the network before computing and applying the gradient updates in an effort to minimize the loss (which was the sum of the cross entropy and l2 losses). We added vertical translations and horizontal flips after each epoch to increase the difficulty of training, as the paper indicates. For the models with spectral parameterization, we used the spectral convolution layer that was described in section 3.1.1. The paper mentioned that they used a Bayesian optimizer to find the best hyperparameter values, but they did not actually state what those values were for the generic and deep architectures, so we hand-tuned the networks on small samples of the training data before training on the larger dataset. Due to the number of models involved with this test and the computational intensity that spectral pooling and spectral parameterization add, we opted to train them on just one of the five batches of CIFAR10 data (i.e. 10,000 of the 50,000 samples in the training set), and even that took 12 hours on a Google Cloud GPU. The results of this test are discussed in section 5.1.3.
