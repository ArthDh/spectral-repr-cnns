This repo is an implementation of Rippel, Snoek, and Adams 2015 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03767.pdf). The project contains python modules and notebooks to implement the three proposals of the paper and to replicate the key findings and experiments of the paper.

## Requirements

The project was developed using Tensorflow 1.4.0 and NumPy 1.13. Certain notebooks require the Pillow 4.3 library to be installed (```sudo pip3 install Pillow```).

## Code Organization

All code is located in the ```src``` folder. Within that folder, Python functions and classes that are shared between multiple notebooks are all located in the ```modules``` folder.

## Notebooks

[```cnn_spectral_parameterization.ipynb```](src/cnn_spectral_parameterization.ipynb) - Alex, please add a description
