This repo is an implementation of Rippel, Snoek, and Adams 2015 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03767.pdf). The project contains python modules and notebooks to implement the three proposals of the paper and to replicate the key findings and experiments of the paper.

## Requirements

The project was performed using Tensorflow 1.4.0 and NumPy 1.13. Certain notebooks require the Pillow 4.3 library to be installed (```sudo pip3 install Pillow```).
